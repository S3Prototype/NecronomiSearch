TODO:
* Then find the searched-for text, and return it and +-300 characters around it
* Put those into individiual boxes, which when you click on them, they fill the screen.
* Put a "Back" button in these boxes for backing out.
* Style search results.
* Decide how you will split up the texts and make them searchable (try to optimize for speed and least resources)
* Use code to break text up and save it to database
* Implement search
* Save searches to redis cache for fast recovery.
* Save previous 3 searches on the client. No need to ping server if it's been searched already. This is not data that will likely update.
* Use a linter to clean up code.
* If you have time, make it an accessible API that anyone can hit, and create an NPM package.
