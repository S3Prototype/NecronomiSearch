DOING:
* Use backend and api to test out search

=====

TODO:
* Style search results.
* Research AWS amplify.
* Decide how you will split up the texts and make them searchable (try to optimize for speed and least resources)
* Use code to break text up and save it to database
* Implement search
* Save searches to redis cache for fast recovery.
* Save previous 3 searches on the client. No need to ping server if it's been searched already. This is not data that will likely update.
* Use a linter to clean up code.
* If you have time, make it an accessible API that anyone can hit, and create an NPM package.
